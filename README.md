# DataStructureCode

a file for the Data Structures in the Textbook. 

- I don't really know how I am supposed to upload C files to git.... 
- this does not seem right... 
- I've looked at other people's git repos and most people only uploaded their source codes
- But I don't really know how to upload only my source codes without messing up my local repo
- This section of README will be deleted once I fix this problem
